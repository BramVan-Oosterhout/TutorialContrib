Welcome to your Katacoda Foswiki tutorial environment!

In this scenario we will explore webs. Foswiki stores topic data in webs. Users can create webs for different type of data.
Foswiki uses the System web to maintain its internal structure and documentation. There is a Sandbox web for experimentation.
Users can create new webs and sub webs if so desired.

The Katacoda training environment is somewhat out of the ordinary. This setup installs Foswiki, listening at port 80 for the http protocol.
Access is through the katacoda-services host, which is accessible with the https protocol.
This leads to a mixed access scenario, which is by default not allowed in modern browsers.
For Firefox  you need to turn off all mixed content checking in

**Please note** that you are `root`on the server.
If you are not a user with root privileges, some commands will need to be `sudo'ed`.
