## Part 1 - Foswiki overview

Scenario 1 - [Introduction](https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/introduction)
Presents the operation of Foswiki out of the box as seen through the user interface.
Although there is much functionality under the hood, the immediately visible capabilities are essentially the entry of text in topics
and the searching across previously entered text.

Scenario 2 - [Webs](https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/webs)
Present the basic data management feature,
the possibility to divide the wiki content in broad classifications: the web. Webs are a basic component in the maintenance and creation of applications.
Webs, sub-webs and the relation between them are fundamental.

Scenario 3 - [Macros](https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/macros)
Presents the use of data definitions to control presentation and behaviour of Foswiki topics.
Macros are the cornerstones of the functioning of Foswiki applications and this chapter presents the mechanisms used.

Scenario 4 - [Meta data](https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/meta)
Presents the implementation of structured data with each topic. This data is referred to as Meta data
and can be entered and manipulated separate from the text content of the wiki topic.

Scenario 5 - [Templates](https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/templates) 
Presents templates. Foswiki templates define the format and presentation of the topic content.
Templates support wholesale changes to the appearance of a Foswiki site.

Scenario 6 - [Extensions](https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/extensions) 
Presents the use of extensions and their interface with the topic content. There are hundreds of plugins shipped with Foswiki.
This scenario demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality.
