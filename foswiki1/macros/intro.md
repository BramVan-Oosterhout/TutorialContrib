Welcome to your Katacoda Foswiki tutorial environment!

Foswiki uses a simple syntax to influence the presentation of the text entered in the wiki.
All words starting and ending with a percent (%) character are potential candidates for translation.
For instance %TOPIC% is translated into the topic name. All Foswiki translation can be viewed as a text manipulation.
Collectively these constructs are referred to as macros, but there are some semantic constructs that distinguish them as
variables, preferences or macros.

The Katacoda training environment is somewhat out of the ordinary. This setup installs Foswiki, listening at port 80 for the http protocol.
Access is through the katacoda-services host, which is accessible with the https protocol.
This leads to a mixed access scenario, which is by default not allowed in modern browsers.
For Firefox  you need to turn off all mixed content checking in

If you are not a user with root privileges, some commands will need to be `sudo'ed`.
