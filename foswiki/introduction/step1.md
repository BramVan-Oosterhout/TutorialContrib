## First encounter

Wait for the scenarion to be configured. Divide the browser in two equal vertical parts. Select the Foswiki tab.

Start foswiki: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/foswiki

When you access your Foswiki installation for the first time you will land on a page that says: "Welcome to the Main web".
Halfway down the page is a **Registration** link. Register yourself as a user
(We'll use: Joe Blog, password: password. Email is not configured and not required)
Once you are registerd, come back to [this page](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/foswiki)

There are some basic features to note:
*   There is a banner at the top with a Jump and a Search box
*   There is a bar on the right with a dozen navigation links 
*   Inside that structure is:
   *   At the top: a breadcrumb, an edit button, an attachment button and a subscribe button
   *   At the bottom is a navigation bar with actions: Edit, Attach, Subscribe, Print version, History: r1, Backlinks, View wiki text, Edit wiki text, More topic actions
   *   And between those two is the topic body, a collection of text and hyperlinks.
   
Each of those artefacts is decribed in the following steps.

Feel free to navigate the links as they are described. The environment is robust enough to support experimentation!
