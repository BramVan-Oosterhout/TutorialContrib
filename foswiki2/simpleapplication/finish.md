This finishes the scenario.

You have successfully built a simple application.

You have built a topic creator for a particular type of topic.

You have defined the field for the topic in a form.

You have defined the template for the default content of the topic

And you have adjusted the grid display for the topic to suit your needs.

It will show us constructs that are useful when building our own applications.

For now bask in the glory of your first successful implementation

Now that you have finished:
Your Katacoda environment for this scenario has been removed!
