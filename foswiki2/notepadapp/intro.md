<!-- Scenario text goes here -->
In scenario 2 we created a simple application to illustrate the use of the components of the wiki work bench. In this scenaro we will elaborate and create an application to create and maintain notes.

Like in the earlier scenario you will be asked to built the application. The starting point is the application previously developed. It is now displayed in the Applications list as `NotePadApp`.  You will:

* Use AUTOINC to create the topic name to avoid duplication
* Create a VIEW template for the Note
* Create an EDIT template for the Note
* Create a button to deploy the application to a web
* Create a Home page for the NotePadApp
* Have some exercises to put the icing on the cake


At the end of this scenario you will have a complete application for your own use!
