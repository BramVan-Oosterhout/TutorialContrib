This tutorial consist of scenarios that are steps with explanations and instructions.
Each step is presented like this page. On the left is a panel that contains the instructions.
On the right is a panel with two tabs: A terminal tab, showing a bash command line interface.
And a Foswiki tab, which presents a web page in a browser.

This tutorial works best if you use a wide screen and divide the screen in one third instruction and two third terminal/browser.

As you start a scenario the environment will be constructed, installing cpan modules and instal and configure Foswiki.
A script will run and complete with `... done` when the configuration is complete. This will take about 60 seconds. 

Throughout the tutorial you will see command line instructions like `ls`{{execute}}.
When you click these, the command will be executed in the terminal window.

When you select the _Foswiki_ tab in the right hand panel after the configuration is complete,
the Foswiki _Main.WebHome_ page will be displayed.

This tutorial has only one Foswiki user configured: _admin_ with password _password_.
This is not suited for a permanent installation. Tutorial scenarios exist for a limited time only.
All details are removed when you complete the scenario or after 45 minutes, whichever comes first.

The instructions in the Scenarios will request you to inspect or create topics in Foswiki.
These references are of the form _Sandbox.WebPreferences_. In this case _Sandbox_ is the web and _WebPreferences_ the topic.
You can navigate to these topics from the Foswiki menus in the Foswiki tab in the right hand side panel.

If you are equipped with dual monitors, you can right click on any link and _Open in new window_.
