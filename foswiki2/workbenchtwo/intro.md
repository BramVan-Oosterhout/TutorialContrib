<!-- Scenario text goes here -->
In this scenario we will inspect two additional components of the wiki work bench:

* RenderWikiTopicView
* RenderTopicsOfType 

These components are simpler than the two we have seen in the previous scenario. They do illustrate some additional functionality and approaches.

Like the previous scenario, this scenario is explanatory. This approach should not discourage you from experimenting with the components presented. Feel free to modify any of the examples to experiment. The solutions will include a "reset' instruction so you can undo all your changes if desired. Or you can restart the scenario to refresh completely.

Throughout this scenario we will be referring to Foswiki macros. These are normally identified by surrounding them with percent (%) marks. For readability this scenario omits the percent marks where the macro is referenced in the plain text. Code blocks will show the complete code, including percent marks.
